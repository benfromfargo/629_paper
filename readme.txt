These files can be used to reproduce every table, figure, and numerical result reported in the paper. 
All relevant code is available in the file ReplicationCode.do. 
Please open this file and make sure that the working directory is set to the folder containing all of the .dta files. 
The comments in the .do file indicate which part of the code corresponds to each table, figure, or numerical result. 

The file House.dta contains the primary data used to analyze the U.S. House. 
Each row corresponds to a member-year, and the columns correspond to member-, district-, and member-year specific covariates. 
Hopefully the names of the variables, examined in conjunction with the replication code and paper, are self-explanatory. 

The file Senate.dta is the analogous data set for the U.S. Senate.

Several additional data sets, used for ancillary analyses, are also included in these replication materials. 
The file Procurements_1983_2010.dta provides state-level data on federal procurements from 1983 to 2010. 
The file FederalEmployment_1969_2013 provides state-level data on military and federal civilian employment from 1969 to 2010. 
The file SenateStateLevelCommittees.dta indicates whether any senator from a particular state in a particular year served on a particular committee. 
The file Employment.dta gives employment statistics by Congressional district provided by the U.S. Census for the 2002-2010 redistricting cycle.
